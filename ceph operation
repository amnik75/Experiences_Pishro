if one of the osd reach full ratio you can increase the full ratio ( before decreasing it is good to delete the unneccessary objects to queue them) 
and then delete the unnecessary objects then set back the full ratio. # you can use below link

# get help for config option
ceph config help <option>
# temporarily set an option using the tell or daemon interfaces on the Ceph CLI. These override values are ephemeral in that they only affect the running process 
and are discarded/lost if the daemon or process restarts.
ceph tell <name> config set <option> <value>
ceph daemon <name> config set <option> <value>
Note that in the ceph config show command output these temporary values will be shown with a source of override.
