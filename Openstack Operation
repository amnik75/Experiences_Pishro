Cloud-based applications typically request more discrete hardware (horizontal scaling) as opposed to traditional applications, which require larger hardware to 
scale (vertical scaling).
OpenStack is designed to be horizontally scalable. Rather than switching to larger servers, you procure more servers and simply install identically configured 
services.
Hardware does not have to be consistent, but it should at least have the same type of CPU to support instance  live migration but for cold migration it shouldn't
be identical.

Examples of burn-in tests include running a CPU or disk benchmark for several days.

openstack --debug server list # use --debug to show api calls
openstack compute service list --long # how to get an overview of your cloud, its shape, size, and current state.
openstack catalog list
nova diagnostics <serverID>

The admin is global, not per project, so granting a user the admin role in any project gives the user administrative rights across the whole cloud.

OpenStack does not configure the databases out of the ordinary. Basic administration includes performance tweaking, high availability, backup, recovery, and 
repairing. For more information, see a standard MySQL administration guide.
Also check RabbitMQ message queues that are growing without being consumed which will indicate which OpenStack services are affected. Restart the affected 
OpenStack services.

Unfortunately, sometimes the error is not apparent from the log files. In this case, switch tactics and use a different command; maybe run the service directly 
on the command line.

# for slowness check this link
https://docs.openstack.org/operations-guide/ops-maintenance-slow.html
Sometimes messages queued for services stay on the queues and are not consumed. This can be due to dead or stagnant services and can be commonly cleared up by 
either restarting the AMQP-related services or the OpenStack service in question.
