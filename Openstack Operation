Cloud-based applications typically request more discrete hardware (horizontal scaling) as opposed to traditional applications, which require larger hardware to 
scale (vertical scaling).
OpenStack is designed to be horizontally scalable. Rather than switching to larger servers, you procure more servers and simply install identically configured 
services.
Hardware does not have to be consistent, but it should at least have the same type of CPU to support instance migration.
Examples of burn-in tests include running a CPU or disk benchmark for several days.

The admin is global, not per project, so granting a user the admin role in any project gives the user administrative rights across the whole cloud.
