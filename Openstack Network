Compute hosts should always have the appropriate NICs configured for promiscuous mode.
OpenStack is able to take advantage of VLANs to isolate the traffic of different projects, even if the projects happen to have instances running on the same 
compute host.
Note that if you are using VLANs on your physical switches to implement project isolation in your OpenStack cloud, you must ensure that all of your 
switchports are configured as trunk ports.

UDP has support for one-to-many communication: sending a single packet to multiple hosts. An application can broadcast a UDP packet to all of the 
etwork hosts on a local network by setting the receiver IP address as the special IP broadcast address 255.255.255.255
An application can also send a UDP packet to a set of receivers using IP multicast.

TCP is a protocol for communication between exactly two endpoints so we can not use it for broadcast and multicast.

Each network namespace also has its own routing table, and in fact this is the main reason for namespaces to exist
A routing table is keyed by destination IP address, so network namespaces are what you need if you want the same destination IP address to mean 
different things at different times- which is something that OpenStack Networking requires for its feature of providing overlapping IP addresses in 
different virtual networks.
Each network namespace also has its own set of iptables (for both IPv4 and IPv6). So, you can apply different security to flows with the same IP addressing 
in different namespaces, as well as different routing.

in the form that OpenStack deployments use, a NAT router on the path between the sender and receiver replaces the packet’s source IP address with the 
router’s public IP address. The router also modifies the source TCP or UDP port to another value, and the router maintains a record of the sender’s 
true IP address and port, as well as the modified IP address and port.
OpenStack uses SNAT to enable applications running inside of instances to connect out to the public Internet.
OpenStack uses DNAT to route packets from instances to the OpenStack metadata service.
OpenStack uses one-to-one NAT to implement floating IP addresses.

In general, the OpenStack Networking software components that handle layer-3 operations impact performance and reliability the most. To improve performance 
and reliability, provider networks move layer-3 operations to the physical network infrastructure.
The Networking service uses a layer-3 agent to manage routers via namespaces.
The Networking service implements the DHCP service using an agent that manages qdhcp namespaces and the dnsmasq service.
If you launch an instance without specifying a security group, the default security group automatically applies to it. Similarly, if you create a port 
without specifying a security group, the default security group automatically applies to it.
Security group rules are stateful. Thus, allowing ingress TCP port 22 for secure shell automatically creates rules that allow return egress traffic and 
ICMP error messages involving those TCP connections.

can we have floating ip without having router for network project?
doesn't gre and vxlan need switch cinfiguration in datacenter?
provider network is flat and project network is gre?
where the security group handle?
how does vm in network comunicate?
route for local network go to qrouter?
why one project network get multiple subnets?
network topology with firewalls?
